*A summery to* **"The fundamentals of a good developer mindset"**

As a developer you should follow this cycle :

---

- Read 
- Understand 
- Plan 
- Solve 
- Feedback  
- Maintenance  
- Repeat

Good developers should always understand the purpose of the software and fully understand the systems and tools they are working with to avoid mistakes.

Design matters as much as the coding procedure does.

Brevity is the soul of wit

Resist adding more code and keep you codes as simple as much as possible as it can be, the simpler it is the better it is.

Finally always remmber that it's okay to ask for help .
